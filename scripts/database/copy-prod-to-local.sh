# Copy Production Firestore to Local Emulator
#
# This script exports Firestore data from production, downloads it, and
# imports it into the local Firebase emulator.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gcloud CLI authenticated and configured
#   - Firebase emulators must be STOPPED (script will verify)
#   - Sufficient disk space for export (~size of production database)
#   - curl or firebase CLI for emulator import
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/database/copy-prod-to-local.sh [-y|--yes]
#
# Options:
#   -y, --yes    Auto-confirm all prompts (useful for non-interactive execution)
#
# Note:
#   The script automatically detects non-interactive execution (e.g., from
#   dev-monitor) and will auto-confirm prompts without requiring the -y flag.
