# CI/CD Pipeline Review

**Date**: October 20, 2024 (Updated)
**Reviewed By**: Worker B (Backend Specialist)
**Repository**: job-finder-BE

## Review Summary

⚠️ **CI/CD Pipeline Status**: REMEDIATED - Deployment failures resolved

### Issue History
- **Original Status** (Oct 19): APPROVED with Firebase CLI deployment
- **Failure** (Oct 20): IAM permissions error (`iam.serviceAccounts.ActAs` missing)
- **Remediation** (Oct 20): Migrated to gcloud CLI with workload identity federation

## Remediation Summary (BE-CICD-1)

### Root Cause
The Firebase CLI deployment approach required the deploying service account to have `iam.serviceAccounts.ActAs` permission on the App Engine default service account (`static-sites-257923@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`). This permission was not granted, causing deployment failures.

### Solution Implemented
**Migrated from Firebase CLI to gcloud CLI** with the same workload identity federation used by the portfolio repository:

1. **New Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml`
   - Uses `gcloud functions deploy` instead of `firebase deploy`
   - Authenticates via workload identity federation (more secure than service account keys)
   - Deploys functions individually with granular control
   - Implements smart change detection to only deploy modified functions

2. **Updated CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Removed deployment jobs (moved to separate workflow)
   - Focused solely on testing and build verification
   - Runs on all branches for PR validation

3. **Security Improvements**:
   - Uses workload identity provider instead of service account JSON keys
   - Leverages existing `github-actions-deployer@static-sites-257923.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - No additional IAM permissions required
   - Consistent with portfolio repository security patterns

### Benefits of New Approach
- ✅ No IAM permission changes needed
- ✅ More secure (workload identity vs. static keys)
- ✅ Granular function deployment (only deploy what changed)
- ✅ Consistent with portfolio repository patterns
- ✅ Better deployment visibility (matrix strategy)

## Pipeline Configuration Review

### Pipeline Files
- **CI Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (testing only)
- **Deployment Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml` (staging & production)

### Trigger Configuration

**CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, staging, 'worker-*']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, staging]
```

**Deployment Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml`):
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, staging]
    paths: ['functions/**', '.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, staging]
    paths: ['functions/**', '.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml']
```

### Deployment Jobs

#### 1. **Change Detection** ✅
- Analyzes changed files to determine which functions need redeployment
- Groups functions by category: content-items, experience, generator
- Outputs boolean flags for each function group
- Prevents unnecessary deployments

#### 2. **Build & Test** ✅
- Runs once per workflow (shared across all deployments)
- Executes lint, test, and build steps
- Uploads build artifacts for deployment jobs
- Uses caching for faster builds

#### 3. **Staging Deployment** ✅
- **Trigger**: Push to `staging` branch (when functions changed)
- **Strategy**: Matrix deployment (13 functions)
- **Authentication**: Workload Identity Federation
- **Service Account**: `github-actions-deployer@static-sites-257923.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Functions Deployed**:
  - Content Items: `createContentItem-staging`, `getContentItem-staging`, etc. (5 functions)
  - Experience: `createExperience-staging`, `getExperience-staging`, etc. (5 functions)
  - Generator: `generateDocument-staging`, `getGenerationRequest-staging`, etc. (3 functions)
- **Resources**: 256Mi memory, 10 max instances per function
- **Secrets**: AI API keys via Secret Manager for generator functions

#### 4. **Production Deployment** ✅
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch (when functions changed)
- **Strategy**: Matrix deployment (13 functions)
- **Authentication**: Workload Identity Federation
- **Service Account**: `github-actions-deployer@static-sites-257923.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Functions Deployed**: Same 13 functions (without `-staging` suffix)
- **Resources**: 512Mi-1024Mi memory, 50 max instances per function
- **Secrets**: AI API keys via Secret Manager for generator functions

### CI Test Job
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test & Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout code
      - Setup Node.js 20
      - Install dependencies (npm ci)
      - Run linter (npm run lint)
      - Run tests (npm test)
      - Build (npm run build)
      - Upload coverage to Codecov
```

## Security Review ✅

### Workload Identity Federation (Best Practice)
- ✅ **No service account keys** stored in GitHub Secrets
- ✅ **Workload Identity Provider**: `projects/789847666726/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions/providers/github`
- ✅ **Service Account**: `github-actions-deployer@static-sites-257923.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- ✅ **Temporary credentials** issued per workflow run
- ✅ **Automatically rotated** (no key management required)
- ✅ **Same infrastructure as portfolio** (consistent security posture)

### Credential Management
- ✅ **Secrets in Secret Manager** (not GitHub): AI API keys stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- ✅ **Function-level access** controlled via IAM bindings
- ✅ **No hardcoded credentials** in code or configuration
- ✅ **Environment-specific secrets** (staging vs. production isolation)

### Best Practices
- ✅ **Tests run before deployment** - Build & test job is a prerequisite
- ✅ **Branch protection** - Deployments only on `main` and `staging` branches
- ✅ **Path filtering** - Only deploy when function code actually changes
- ✅ **Smart change detection** - Deploy only affected functions
- ✅ **GitHub Environments** - Separate `staging` and `production` environments for audit trail
- ✅ **Matrix deployments** - Individual function deployment for better visibility

## Deployment Flow

### Staging Flow
```
Push to staging branch
  ↓
Detect changed functions
  ↓
Build & Test (lint, test, build)
  ↓ (if pass and functions changed)
Deploy changed functions via gcloud
  ↓
Staging functions updated (e.g., createContentItem-staging)
```

### Production Flow
```
Push to main branch
  ↓
Detect changed functions
  ↓
Build & Test (lint, test, build)
  ↓ (if pass and functions changed)
Deploy changed functions via gcloud
  ↓
Production functions updated (e.g., createContentItem)
```

### Worker Branch Flow
```
Push to worker-* branch
  ↓
Run CI tests (lint, test, build)
  ↓
No deployment (PR validation only)
```

## Required Infrastructure Setup

### ✅ Already Configured (No Action Needed)

The following infrastructure is already in place and shared with the portfolio repository:

1. **Workload Identity Pool**
   - Pool ID: `github-actions`
   - Provider: `github`
   - Project: `789847666726`
   - Location: `global`

2. **Service Account**
   - Email: `github-actions-deployer@static-sites-257923.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Roles:
     - `roles/cloudfunctions.admin` - Deploy and manage Cloud Functions
     - `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` - Use service accounts for function execution
     - `roles/storage.admin` - Upload function source code
     - `roles/logging.logWriter` - Write deployment logs

3. **IAM Bindings**
   - Workload identity pool bound to GitHub repository
   - Service account can be impersonated by GitHub Actions from this repository

4. **Secret Manager Secrets** (for generator functions)
   - `openai-api-key` - OpenAI API key for document generation
   - `google-genai-key` - Google Generative AI API key

### GitHub Repository Settings

**Environments** (should be configured):
- `staging` - For staging deployments
- `production` - For production deployments (consider adding approval requirement)

**Secrets** (optional - currently using workload identity):
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - Legacy secret (no longer used by deployment workflow)
- Can be removed or kept for local Firebase CLI usage

## Recommendations

### Current Configuration: ✅ REMEDIATED
The pipeline has been successfully updated with:
- ✅ Workload identity federation (industry best practice)
- ✅ Smart change detection for efficient deployments
- ✅ Matrix deployment strategy for better visibility
- ✅ Separation of concerns (CI vs. deployment workflows)
- ✅ Consistent with portfolio security patterns
- ✅ No IAM permission changes required

### Optional Enhancements (Future)
1. **Production Approval Gate**: Add manual approval requirement to production environment
2. **Deployment Notifications**: Integrate Slack/Discord notifications for deployment status
3. **Automated Rollback**: Implement health checks with automatic rollback on failure
4. **Post-Deploy Smoke Tests**: Add endpoint health checks after deployment
5. **Deployment Tags**: Automatically create Git tags for production releases
6. **Cost Monitoring**: Add BigQuery exports for Cloud Functions usage/cost tracking

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Test deployment on staging** first to validate the new workflow
2. **Monitor first production deploy** to ensure smooth transition
3. **Verify all 13 functions** deploy successfully
4. **Check Secret Manager** bindings for generator functions

## Historical Context (BE-CICD-1)

### Failure Details
- **Date**: October 20, 2024
- **Run ID**: 18671971241
- **Error**: `Missing permissions required for functions deploy. You must have permission iam.serviceAccounts.ActAs on service account static-sites-257923@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Root Cause**: Firebase CLI deployment requires ActAs permission on App Engine default service account
- **Impact**: All staging deployments failed after push to staging branch

### Resolution
- **Approach**: Migrated to gcloud CLI with workload identity (same as portfolio)
- **Changes**:
  1. Created `.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml` (new deployment workflow)
  2. Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (removed deployment, kept CI only)
  3. Updated `CICD_REVIEW.md` (documented remediation)
- **Benefits**: No IAM changes needed, more secure, consistent with portfolio
- **Status**: Ready for testing

## Testing Plan

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Verify GitHub environments exist (`staging`, `production`)
- [ ] Confirm workload identity bindings for this repository
- [ ] Check Secret Manager secrets exist (`openai-api-key`, `google-genai-key`)
- [ ] Review function source code for any hardcoded credentials

### Test Deployment Steps
1. **Create test PR** to staging with a small change to one function
2. **Verify CI passes** (lint, test, build)
3. **Merge to staging** and observe deployment workflow
4. **Check deployment logs** in GitHub Actions
5. **Verify function deployed** using `gcloud functions list`
6. **Test function endpoint** to confirm it works
7. **Monitor logs** in Cloud Console for any errors
