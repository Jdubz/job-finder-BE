Title: PHASE-6-2 ‚Äî Production Deployment with Zero-Downtime

## Summary

**Problem**: After successful staging validation, the backend needs to be deployed to production with zero downtime, comprehensive monitoring, and a tested rollback plan in case of issues.

**Goal**: Execute production deployment of all backend functions following zero-downtime strategy, implement production monitoring and alerting, validate complete system functionality, and ensure rollback procedures are documented and tested.

**Impact**: Completes backend migration from portfolio to dedicated job-finder-BE repository. Enables production users to access all backend functionality with confidence in system reliability and recoverability.

## Architecture References

> **üìö Read these docs first for context:**

- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Production deployment commands
- **[BACKEND_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](../../../docs/architecture/BACKEND_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)** - Phase 6, Task 6.2 - Deployment strategy
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/manage-functions#deployment

**Key concepts to understand**:
- Blue-Green Deployment: New version deployed alongside old, traffic switched when ready
- Gradual Rollout: Deploy to subset of users first, then full rollout
- Rollback Plan: Documented procedure to revert to previous version if issues arise

---

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Pre-Production Preparation
1. **Final staging validation**
   - What: Comprehensive testing in staging environment
   - Where: Staging environment
   - Why: Final confidence check before production
   - Test: All workflows tested successfully in staging

2. **Backup production data**
   - What: Export Firestore data and function configurations
   - Where: Firebase console and gcloud CLI
   - Why: Enable recovery if deployment fails
   - Test: Backups created and verified

3. **Review rollback procedures**
   - What: Document and test rollback process
   - Where: `docs/ROLLBACK.md`
   - Why: Ensure quick recovery if issues arise
   - Test: Rollback procedure documented and rehearsed

4. **Notify stakeholders**
   - What: Inform team of deployment window
   - Where: Slack/email communication
   - Why: Ensure team availability for monitoring
   - Test: All stakeholders acknowledged

### Phase 2: Production Deployment
5. **Deploy functions to production**
   - What: Deploy all functions using gradual rollout if possible
   - Where: Firebase production project
   - Why: Make functions available to production users
   - Test: All functions deployed and healthy

6. **Deploy Firestore rules and indexes**
   - What: Deploy security rules and indexes to production
   - Where: Firebase production project
   - Why: Ensure security and performance in production
   - Test: Rules and indexes active

7. **Deploy storage rules**
   - What: Deploy production storage security rules
   - Where: Firebase production project
   - Why: Secure document storage in production
   - Test: Storage rules enforced

8. **Update frontend production URLs**
   - What: Ensure job-finder-FE production points to new backend
   - Where: Frontend production environment variables
   - Why: Direct production traffic to new backend
   - Test: Frontend calls new backend URLs

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation
9. **Run production smoke tests**
   - What: Execute critical path tests against production
   - Where: Production environment
   - Why: Verify deployment health immediately
   - Test: All smoke tests pass

10. **Monitor initial traffic**
    - What: Watch logs, metrics, and errors for 1-2 hours
    - Where: Firebase console, Cloud Monitoring
    - Why: Catch issues early while team is available
    - Test: No critical errors, performance within SLAs

11. **Validate end-to-end workflows**
    - What: Test complete user journeys in production
    - Where: Production environment
    - Why: Ensure all features work correctly
    - Test: Job submission, document generation, configuration work

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Tasks
12. **Configure production monitoring**
    - What: Set up dashboards, alerts, and SLOs
    - Where: Google Cloud Monitoring
    - Why: Ongoing health monitoring
    - Test: Dashboards show data, alerts configured

13. **Clean up portfolio functions**
    - What: Remove job-finder functions from portfolio project
    - Where: Portfolio repository
    - Why: Complete migration, avoid confusion
    - Test: Only contact form remains in portfolio

14. **Update documentation**
    - What: Update all docs to reflect production URLs
    - Where: README, API docs, deployment docs
    - Why: Ensure documentation is current
    - Test: All docs accurate and up-to-date

## Technical Details

### Production Deployment Strategy

**Zero-Downtime Approach**:
1. Deploy new function versions (creates new versions, old remain active)
2. Gradually route traffic to new versions (if supported)
3. Monitor error rates and performance
4. If healthy, route 100% traffic to new versions
5. Delete old versions after validation period
