## Summary

**Problem**: Before deploying to production, the backend must be deployed to a staging environment for final validation, smoke testing, and integration testing with the frontend staging deployment.

**Goal**: Successfully deploy all backend functions to Firebase staging environment, configure monitoring and logging, run smoke tests to verify deployment health, and validate integration with job-finder-FE staging.

**Impact**: Provides safe environment for final testing before production release. Catches deployment-specific issues and validates complete system integration.

## Technical Details

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Pre-deployment checks
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build

# Switch to staging project
firebase use staging

# Deploy everything (functions, rules, indexes)
firebase deploy

# Or deploy selectively
firebase deploy --only functions
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
firebase deploy --only storage

# Verify deployment
firebase functions:list
```

### Smoke Test Script

```bash
# smoke-tests.sh
#!/bin/bash

STAGING_URL="https://us-central1-job-finder-staging.cloudfunctions.net"
AUTH_TOKEN="your-staging-auth-token"

echo "Running smoke tests against staging..."

# Test 1: Health check
echo "Test 1: Health check"
RESPONSE=$(curl -s "$STAGING_URL/health")
if [[ $RESPONSE == *"healthy"* ]]; then
  echo "âœ“ Health check passed"
else
  echo "âœ— Health check failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 2: Submit job (requires auth)
echo "Test 2: Submit job"
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$STAGING_URL/submitJob" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{"url":"https://test.com/job","companyName":"Test"}}')

if [[ $RESPONSE == *"\"success\":true"* ]]; then
  echo "âœ“ Job submission passed"
else
  echo "âœ— Job submission failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 3: Get queue stats (requires editor auth)
echo "Test 3: Get queue stats"
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$STAGING_URL/getQueueStats" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{}}')

if [[ $RESPONSE == *"\"success\":true"* ]]; then
  echo "âœ“ Queue stats passed"
else
  echo "âœ— Queue stats failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 4: Get stop list
echo "Test 4: Get configuration"
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$STAGING_URL/getStopList" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{}}')

if [[ $RESPONSE == *"\"success\":true"* ]]; then
  echo "âœ“ Configuration retrieval passed"
else
  echo "âœ— Configuration retrieval failed"
  exit 1
fi

echo "All smoke tests passed!"
```

### Monitoring Configuration

**Key Metrics to Monitor**:
- Function execution count
- Function execution time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate and error types
- Memory usage
- Cold start frequency
- Firestore read/write operations
- Secret Manager access count

**Alert Conditions**:
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Function execution time p95 > 10 seconds
- Function crashes > 10 per hour
- Firestore quota exceeded

### Key Implementation Notes

**Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy-staging.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting staging deployment..."

# Pre-deployment checks
echo "Running pre-deployment checks..."
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build

# Switch to staging
echo "Switching to staging project..."
firebase use staging

# Deploy functions
echo "Deploying functions..."
firebase deploy --only functions --force

# Deploy Firestore configuration
echo "Deploying Firestore rules and indexes..."
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes

# Deploy storage rules
echo "Deploying storage rules..."
firebase deploy --only storage

# Verify deployment
echo "Verifying deployment..."
firebase functions:list

# Run smoke tests
echo "Running smoke tests..."
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh

echo "Staging deployment complete!"
```

**Monitoring Dashboard Setup**:
```typescript
// scripts/setup-monitoring.ts
import { Logging } from '@google-cloud/logging';
import { Monitoring } from '@google-cloud/monitoring';

export async function setupMonitoring(projectId: string) {
  const monitoring = new Monitoring.MetricServiceClient();

  // Create custom metrics
  const customMetrics = [
    {
      type: 'custom.googleapis.com/function/job_submissions',
      description: 'Number of job submissions',
    },
    {
      type: 'custom.googleapis.com/function/document_generations',
      description: 'Number of document generations',
    },
  ];

  for (const metric of customMetrics) {
    await monitoring.createMetricDescriptor({
      name: `projects/${projectId}`,
      metricDescriptor: metric,
    });
  }

  // Create alert policies
  // ... alert configuration
}
```

## Success Metrics

**How we'll measure success**:
- Zero deployment errors
- All smoke tests pass (100% success rate)
- Function cold start < 3 seconds
- Function execution time < 5 seconds (p95)
- Error rate < 1%
- Frontend integration fully functional

---

## Notes

**Implementation Tips**:
- Deploy during low-traffic hours if possible
- Keep rollback plan ready (previous deployment version)
- Monitor logs actively for 1 hour after deployment
- Test all critical user workflows manually
- Verify secrets are accessible from functions
- Check CORS configuration allows frontend requests
- Ensure rate limiting is appropriate for staging
- Test with real user accounts (not just test accounts)

**Rollback Procedure**:
```bash
# If issues found, rollback to previous version
firebase deploy --only functions:functionName --force
# Or use Firebase Console â†’ Functions â†’ Versions â†’ Rollback
```

**Common Issues**:
- Missing secrets: Verify Secret Manager permissions
- CORS errors: Check allowed origins in config
- Firestore permission errors: Verify rules deployed
- Function timeouts: Check memory and timeout settings
- Cold starts: Consider minimum instances for critical functions
