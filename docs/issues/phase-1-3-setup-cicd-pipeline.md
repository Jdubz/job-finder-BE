## Issue Metadata

```yaml
Title: PHASE-1-3 â€” Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
Labels: priority-p1, repository-backend, type-devops, status-todo, phase-1
Assignee: Worker A
Priority: P1-High
Estimated Effort: 4-6 hours
Repository: job-finder-BE
```

## Summary

**Problem**: The job-finder-BE repository needs automated CI/CD to ensure code quality, run tests, and deploy to staging/production environments without manual intervention.

**Goal**: Implement GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration (linting, testing) and continuous deployment (automated staging deployments, manual production deployments with approvals).

**Impact**: Reduces deployment errors, enforces code quality standards, and enables rapid iteration with confidence. Ensures all code is tested before reaching production.

- Environment Separation: Staging for testing, production for users
- Secret Management: GitHub secrets for Firebase credentials

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Set Up CI Workflow
1. **Create CI workflow file**
   - What: Create GitHub Actions workflow for pull requests
   - Where: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Why: Runs tests and linting on every PR to catch issues early
   - Test: Workflow runs on PR creation, passes/fails correctly

2. **Configure test job**
   - What: Set up job to install dependencies, build, lint, and test
   - Where: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - `test` job
   - Why: Validates code quality before merging
   - Test: Job runs successfully on sample PR

3. **Add branch protection rules**
   - What: Require CI to pass before merging to staging/main
   - Where: GitHub repository settings
   - Why: Prevents broken code from being merged
   - Test: Cannot merge PR with failing CI

### Phase 2: Set Up Staging Deployment
4. **Create staging deployment workflow**
   - What: Auto-deploy to staging on merge to `staging` branch
   - Where: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`
   - Why: Automatically updates staging environment for testing
   - Test: Merge to staging triggers deployment

5. **Configure Firebase staging credentials**
   - What: Add Firebase service account and project ID as GitHub secrets
   - Where: GitHub repository secrets (FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_STAGING, FIREBASE_PROJECT_STAGING)
   - Why: Enables GitHub Actions to deploy to Firebase
   - Test: Deployment workflow authenticates successfully

### Phase 3: Set Up Production Deployment
6. **Create production deployment workflow**
   - What: Manual deployment to production with approval
   - Where: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`
   - Why: Controlled production deployments with human oversight
   - Test: Manual workflow trigger deploys to production

7. **Configure Firebase production credentials**
   - What: Add production Firebase credentials as GitHub secrets
   - Where: GitHub repository secrets (FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRODUCTION, FIREBASE_PROJECT_PRODUCTION)
   - Why: Separate credentials for production security
   - Test: Production deployment authenticates and deploys

### Phase 4: Add Deployment Notifications
8. **Add status notifications**
   - What: Configure workflow to notify on success/failure (Slack, email, or GitHub)
   - Where: Workflow steps with notification actions
   - Why: Team knows immediately when deployments succeed or fail
   - Test: Notifications sent on deployment completion

## Notes

**Questions? Need clarification?**
- Comment on this issue with specific questions
- Tag @PM for guidance
- Reference GitHub Actions documentation

**Implementation Tips**:
- Test workflows on a feature branch first before pushing to staging
- Use `workflow_dispatch` for manual trigger testing
- Store all sensitive data in GitHub secrets, never in code
- Consider adding deployment previews for PRs
- Set up Slack/Discord webhook for deployment notifications
- Use environment protection rules for production (require approval)

**Getting Firebase Service Account**:
```bash
# Generate service account key
firebase login:ci

# Or create service account in GCP Console:
# IAM & Admin â†’ Service Accounts â†’ Create Key (JSON)
# Store JSON contents in GitHub secret
```
