# Security Runbooks

Authoritative security documentation for the backend lives in this directory.

- **[Security Policy](security-policy.md)** — Reporting process, triage SLAs, hardening standards, and incident response checklist.
- **[Firestore Rules & Index Verification](index-verification.md)** — Step-by-step guide to validate and deploy Firestore security rules and composite indexes after changes.

Add additional runbooks here (e.g., auth audits, incident postmortems) and update this index accordingly.
