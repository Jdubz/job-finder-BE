## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start - Deploy to Staging

```bash
# 1. Ensure Firebase CLI is authenticated
firebase login

# 2. Run automated deployment
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh

# 3. Run smoke tests (optional, requires auth token)
export STAGING_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Pre-deployment checks
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build

# Switch to staging
firebase use staging

# Deploy everything
firebase deploy

# Or deploy selectively
firebase deploy --only functions
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### Post-Deployment

1. **Run smoke tests**: `./scripts/smoke-tests.sh`
2. **Check logs**: `firebase functions:log`
3. **Monitor console**: Firebase Console → Functions
4. **Test integration**: Verify frontend can communicate with backend
